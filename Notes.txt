Time taken: maybe 1 hour for the actual props part and 30min for styles.

Questions: I commented out my attempt to try to parse an api response to create the default props for the pokedex, I spent way too much time doing this and it kinda came down to me not fully grasping how to format the data from the response using map (again lol). So i guess my question is,how can I loop over a GET request, save and resolve the promises and then output a formatted json object of just the right data using map (eg. id, name, type, experience and sprite.png)?? I should note I made anonther function to pass in a random number as the id in the API URL, so the pokemon are random. I realized that this was kinda missing the point of default props anyways, seeing as they are static values and how this might be solved using state, but that doesn't really matter as much to me as my lack of understanding using when using map with api data.
